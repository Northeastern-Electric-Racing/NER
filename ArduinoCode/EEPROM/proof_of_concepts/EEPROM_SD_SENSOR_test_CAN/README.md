# Third EEPROM Test
### Using EEPROM Reading and Writing with SD Card Reading and Writing, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Sample w/ CAN Bus Integration

Has configurable LED output pin and distance sensor parameter based on CAN configuration message. Turns on set LED pin if the ultrasonic distance sensor detects an object within the set parameters.
The distance data and any alerts are written to DATA.txt on an SD card

## TODO

Test Functionality on board <br />
