# Third EEPROM Test
### Using EEPROM Reading and Writing with SD Card Reading and Writing, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Sample w/ CAN Bus Integration

Writes sensor parameters to the EEPROM (in this case, 10) to turn on the LED if the distance detected is
less than the specified parameters.
The distance and any important messages are written to the SD card in the DATA.txt file included

//## TODO

<br />

## Functionalities:

Writing to SD Card <br /> <br />
Reading and Writing to/from EEPROM <br />
Pulling Pin #'s and Parameters from EEPROM <br /> <br />
Reconfiguring Pin #'s and Parameters based on CAN configuration message <br />
Sending configuration message <br /> <br />
Incorporating Sample Sensor (Ultrasonic Distance Sensor) <br />
