# Second EEPROM Test
###### Integrating EEPROM Reading and Writing with SD Card Reading and Writing, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Sample

Writes sensor parameters to the EEPROM (in this case, 10) to turn on the LED if the distance detected is
less than the specified parameters.
The distance and any important messages are written to the SD card in the DATA.txt file included

## Functionalities:
